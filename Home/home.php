    <span class="largeText">Hey y'all! <br/></span>
    
    <p>I'm Jessica.  I'm a software developer. I love building quality web a mobile apps to boost your productivity and help you accomplish your goals.</p>
    <p>When I'm not at the computer writin' code and blastin' country music and show tunes, I'm playin' with my little boy, singin' aforementioned show tunes with my husband, or curled up on the couch with a fantasy novel and a bowl of mint chocolate chip ice cream.</p>
    <p>I grew up around technology and computers; my dad is a network administrator.  But I didn't discover my love for coding until my sophmore year of college.  I took an intro to programming class, and it just clicked. The computer and I were totally on the same (digital) page.  I love writing a program and seeing it do what I created it to do.</p>
    <p>I recently took a short break from work to have a baby and build this little website.  I am a firm believer that a mother should be able to put her family first yet continue to pursue her own passions and dreams.</p>
    <p>I was raised in the South. Although I've spent several years in Utah, we've recently moved to Mississippi, and I'm glad to be back home where the cicadas chirp and the magnolias bloom (if you don't know what I'm talkin' about, then bless your heart).</p>
    <p>I believe in God, kindness, and Southern Hospitality.  I can be a bit of a perfectionist, but I love this quote from <b>Anne of Green Gables</b> by Lucy Maud Montgomery:</p>
    <span class="quote"> "Tomorrow is always fresh, with no mistakes in it."</span>
